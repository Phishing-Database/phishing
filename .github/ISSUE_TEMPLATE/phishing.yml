      List the Domain/URL/IP for where the phishing occurs is
      **mandatory**. 
      The backticks (`) surrounding the Domain/URL/IPs are important,
      it prevents the URL from becoming clickable.
      
      Warn with "NSFW" where applicable.

      **Help** To make the right commit for IP-addresses you have to
      also prefix the CIDR notation, if you don't know what a CIDR
      notation is, the right value is most likely `/32`, which in short
      means exactly this IP address.
