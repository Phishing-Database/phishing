        List the Domain/URI/IP for where the phishing occurs is
        **mandatory**. 
        The backticks (`) surrounding the Domain/URL/IPs are important,
        it prevents the URL from becoming clickable.

        Warn with "NSFW" where applicable.

        **Help** To make the right commit for IP-addresses you have to
        also prefix the CIDR notation, if you don't know what a CIDR
        notation is, the right value is most likely `/32`, which in short
        means exactly this IP address.
